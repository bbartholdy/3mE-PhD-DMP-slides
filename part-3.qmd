## Data storage

Secure and backed-up (e.g. [Project Data U:](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=846ebb16181c43b5836c063a917dd199))

Or cloud solutions

- SURFDrive: 500GB
- OneDrive: 1TB

. . .

Cloud solutions are deleted after your contract ends

. . .

Send encrypted files via [SURFfilesender](https://filesender.surf.nl/)

## Data backup

3 copies of data (including active work)

. . .

2 media

. . .

1 off-site

## Data organisation

Think about it. [Can someone else take over without your help?]{.fragment}

. . .

File naming should be consistent and understandable (to humans and machines)

- include the date created (where applicable)
- no special characters or spaces (excl. `-`, `_`)

. . .

Use version control.

## Documentation

Best if done during the project!

README file(s)

Paper/electronic lab notebooks

Annotated scripts or Code notebooks (e.g. R Notebook and Jupyter Notebook)

## Personal and confidential data

Working with human participants requires an HREC application:

- [HREC checklist](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/hrec-approval-1-application)
- Informed consent materials
- **Data Management Plan**

. . .

## Archiving data/code

As a PhD student you are resposible for:

>Ensuring that all data and code underlying completed PhD theses are
appropriately documented and accessible for at least 10 years from the end
of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons
which make research data unsuitable for sharing.

\- [3mE RDM Policy](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/2020_3mE_Research_Data_Management_Policy.pdf)

Minimal requirement:

- deposition of processed data underlying figures and conclusions in published papers and dissertations.

Encouraged:

- deposition of raw data, software, data analysis scripts, protocols, etc.

## Publishing data


> Data are available upon request to corresponding author.

. . .

![GIPHY](https://media.giphy.com/media/5fBH6zf7l8bxukYh74Q/giphy.gif)

## Publishing data

Considerations

. . .

> As open as possible; as closed as necessary.


- what to share
  - validate and reproduce results
  - confidentiality, intellectual property, ethics and privacy, patent
  - journal requirements for data availability
- how to share
  - certified repositories
  - license

## Publishing data

Not suitable for sharing:

- identifiable personal data (name, email, BSN, biometrics, etc.)
- confidential commercial data
- third party data (not necessary to re-share if published)
- other confidential data (nuclear research, military research)
- large datasets (think terabytes)

. . .

If in doubt, contact supervisor, owner of data, faculty contract manager, privacy officer, data steward

## Publishing data {.nested}

### Personal data

Data relating to identifiable person

- Can publish:
  - anonymised or aggregated data
- Can archive (restricted access):
  - pseudonymised data

. . .

Consent from participants needed for publishing and archiving

. . .

Can make empty informed consent form available

### Data involved in patent

- Can publish:
  - all data under temporary embargo (until IP is protected)
  - be careful with metadata

<!-- end: testing rotated h2 title -->

## Publishing data

### Be FAIR

![](img/FAIRdataprinciples_foster.png){height="250"}

**F**indable - persistent identifier (e.g. DOI) and detailed metadata  
**A**ccessible - long-term accessibility of data (or just metadata if restricted)  
**I**nteroperable - non-proprietary file formats  
**R**eusable - proper documentation and clear license

### and CARE

![](img/care-principles.png)

**C**ollective benefit - inclusive development and equitable outcomes  
**A**uthority to control - Rights, interests, and governance  
**R**esponsibility - respect, reciprocity, and trust  
**E**thics - minimising harm and maximising benefit

<br>

. . .

(You can of course use these in addition to a certified repository)
:::
::::

## Publishing data

### 4TU.ResearchData

## Publishing software

TU Delft [policy](https://zenodo.org/record/4629662#.Y4d-hH3MJhE) on research software

- Can it be made open source?
  + If yes, TU Delft transfers copyright to you
  + If no, contact your data steward
- Apply pre-approved open source license
- Publish the software (e.g. GitHub/Lab + 4TU for DOI)
- Register software with [PURE](https://pure.tudelft.nl/admin)
  + If published in 4TU.ResearchData, this is done automatically

## Publishing software

License compatibility

:::

## Publishing software

**Commercial vs. open source**

Can co-exist (e.g. RStudio, NextCloud, ownCloud, Linux distros, WordPress)

- Software is free and open source, maintenance and support is paid
- Free for individuals, commercial licenses
- Free basic model, proprietary advanced usage


## Publishing protocols

protocols.io

- publish detailed protocols
  - experiments
  - computations
- assign DOI for publication
- update with new version

## Reproducibility {background-image="img/ReproducibleJourney.jpg" background-position="right" background-size="40%"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}
**Reproducible:** Reproducing results using the same methods and data

**Replicable:** Reproducing results using the same methods but DIFFERENT data

[Main causes of failure to reproduce research:]{.fragment}

- Selective reporting
- Methods, code unavailable
- data unavailable

[<https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a>]{.fragment}

[Another barrier to reproducibility is the use of proprietary software and file formats (Not all institutions have a MatLab license - very few individuals)]{.fragment}

## Steps towards Open Science {.scrollable}

NOT everything everywhere all at once - start small

- **transparency**
  - thorough documentation (data collection, methodology, analysis steps)
  - analysis outputs (from SPSS, MatLab, etc.)
  - raw data
- **research compendium**
  - documentation (README)
  - code
  - data (raw and processed)
- **executable article**
  - documentation (README)
  - code
  - data
  - computational environement (Docker, Binder, etc.)
